## Description

Reaksi is an attempt to understand how React works under the hood by recreating many of it's features. We make Reaksi API very similar to React API, so an experienced React user will have zero learning curve and will be encouraged to try it out.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started with reaksi is to clone the template from GitHub repository :

```bash
npx degit nettohadi/reaksi-template my-reaksi-project
cd my-reaksi-project
npm install
```

If you prefer to use Typescript, you can clone the template for Typescript :

```bash
npx degit nettohadi/reaksi-template-ts my-reaksi-project
cd my-reaksi-project
npm install
```

To watch for changes and test the project locally : 

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build the project for production :

```bash
npm run build
```

## Hooks

This is an ongoing process, meaning  some hooks are not yet implemented. Below are the available hooks in Reaksi :
- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useRef
- useSelector (Redux)
- useDispatch (Redux)
- useRouter

For now, you can refer to React doc to find out how above hooks are used.
