## Description

Reaksi is a React like library with the same modern API. This is an attempt to understand how React works under the hood by recreating many of it's features.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started with reaksi is to clone the template from GitHub repository :

```bash
npx degit nettohadi/reaksi-template my-reaksi-project
cd my-reaksi-project
npm install
```

If you prefer to use Typescript, you can clone the template for Typescript :

```bash
npx degit nettohadi/reaksi-template-ts my-reaksi-project
cd my-reaksi-project
npm install
```

To watch for changes and test the project locally : 

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build the project for production :

```bash
npm run build
```

## Hooks

This is an ongoing process, meaning  some hooks are not yet implemented. Below are the available hooks in Reaksi :
- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useRef
- useSelector (Redux)
- useDispatch (Redux)
- useRouter

For now, you can refer to React doc to find out how above hooks are used.
